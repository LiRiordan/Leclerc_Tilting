# Leclerc_Tilting

In "Cluster structures on strata of flag varieties", Leclerc describes (section 4.8) how to construct a cluster tilting object in his categorification of Richardsons. 

The data of a Richardson variety is determined by a pair of permutations v, w in S_m with v =< w in the Bruhat order. If v = w_{0}^{K} u where W^{K} is a parabolic associated to the Grassmannian Gr(k,m) 
and u is in W^{K}\W then the Richardson variety lives in the Grassmannian Gr(k,m). To v we associate the k-index given by u^{-1}([1,2,3,...,k]).

This program is an app which speeds up many of the computations we were having to do daily. The first tab is for computing projective injectives in various categorifications of the Richardsons described above.
The second tab then performs Leclerc's algorithm and lifts it to CM(C) (from "A categorification of Grassmannian cluster algebras" by Jensen, King and Su).
